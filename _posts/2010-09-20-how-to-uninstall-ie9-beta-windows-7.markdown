IE9 Installs as a systemÂ update, so can be uninstalled from Uninstall update cp menu.

Open Control Panel-> Uninstall a program and click View installed updates (upper left). This opens a listing of Windows updates that have been applied. Under the Microsoft Windows group, find Windows Internet Explorer 9, right-click and uninstall.
