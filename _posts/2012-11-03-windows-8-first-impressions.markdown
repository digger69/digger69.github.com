First impressions... it is fast. I installed it on my lenovo t410 (i5 w/ 8gb ram) and it really is about 50% faster than Windows 7 running on that same box. I just finished [installing ubuntu 12.10](http://blog.nadigs.net/mark/2012/11/03/first-time-installing-ubuntu/) on the same box and here's a comparison of boot times :


#### ubuntu 12.10


21s to login
35s to desktop


#### Win7 enterprise


42s to login
1"25s to desktop.


#### Win8 pro


29s to login
43s to desktop


## Touch


Even though it is clear that this was designed for "touch" I found the mouse interactions to be pretty intuitive. Even the somewhat jarring switch to classic desktop isn't as bad as I had anticipated.
