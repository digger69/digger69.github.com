Salient points:



	
  1. Download [SDK](http://developer.android.com/index.html), unzip install platforms.

	
  2. Go into tools and run ddms.

	
  3. On device: Settings -> Applications -> Development, turn on USB Debugging. Connect the device.

	
  4. Back in ddms you should see your device listed, select Device -> Screen Capture. FTW!
