Just set up 'blog.nadigs.net' and I'm already anticipating people getting it wrong as "blogs.nadigs.net". I haven't ever set this up before, but it was easy-peasy.



	
  1. Add A record in DNS for blogs.nadigs.net going to my same IP.

	
  2. Update my dynamic dns updater script. I really need to open source that vb.net service program - but this is a good example why I haven't yet : it's full of hard coded config options.

	
  3. Enable Http Redirect (CP-> Turn Windows Features on/off -> IIS -> WWW svc -> Common HTTP -> HTTP redirection).

	
  4. Add a site in IIS for blogs.nadigs.net pointing to an empty folder.

	
  5. Followed directions from [here](http://www.iis.net/ConfigReference/system.webServer/httpRedirect) to HTTP Redirect -> add entry for blogs.nadigs.net to redirect to blog.nadigs.net w/ 301.


that was easy.
