Windows 7 has built in "burn disk image" capability. Just right-click on the ISO and select "burn...". Note: If you've registered any other program with an ISO extension, you may have lost this as I did. See HKCR\Windows.IsoFile\Shell\Burn for path and parms to IsoBurn.exe in Windows 7.

For other versions of Windows use this to burn

For mounting

[http://www.poweriso.com/index.htm](http://www.poweriso.com/index.htm)  (PowerISO is freeware so there shouldn’t be any problem. Its only limitations is the screen that asks you to register it and a limit of 300Mb when creating or editing files. Mounting files doesn’t come with limitations however.)
