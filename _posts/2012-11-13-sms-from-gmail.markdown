Got a new security system set up that can shoot me an email when something of note happens. However, I want to get SMS as well. Gmail allows sms reminders from events, but not from an email filter :/ Â My second go-to was IFTTT, however they can call, but not SMS. Thankfully I came across a [blog post](http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/939/sms_email_cingular_nextel_sprint_tmobile_verizon_virgin/) that details how to email->SMS for specific providers, which is all I needed. Now I have a rule in gmail that forwards all security emails to my cell provder-specific email.
