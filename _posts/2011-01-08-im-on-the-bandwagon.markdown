Ok, I finally gave up my "smartphone", the TMO DASH flashed w/ latest WMO 6.5 ROM and jumped on the 'droid bandwagon w/ a TMO myTouch 4g. My initial impression was that of being overwhelmed. The bloatware that comes pre-installed reminds me of my first e-machine ;)  




 




First order of business was to get my outlook contacts, calendar and tasks synced to my phone. I'm used to my phone reminding me ... "hey, you have a meeting in 15 minutes". It is not as critical now that I work from home, but still handy. My first research seemed to indicate the best I could do is export my contacts from outlook and import them into gmail and install a plugin from google to sync my calendar. No help for tasks either. However, after conferring w/ Tom V (also 'droided) he clued me into just adding my exchange account and violoa, it just works (for contacts/calendar - still no joy for tasks).




 




The second critical app for me has been [PasswordSafe](http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/) which is an open source password keeper. Believe it or not, I have 357 items in there... Thankfully, I found an open source port of this for 'droid [PasswdSafe](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/passwdsafe/index.php?title=Main_Page) also on SF. Note: Seems there are a lot of suspiciously similarly named apps/projects both in markeplace and sourceforge. I'd only trust the JeffHarris one linked above. After installing and confirming it worked, I decided it was time to put my money where my app was... So, I donated a little cash to both projects. I really rely on this app heavily, so it is money well spent.




 




Turns out PasswdSafe can integrate with dropbox as well. I'll have to check that out when I get back from vacation. For now, I'll just copy the pw file to my SD card. 




 




I'd better go pack. Early flight in the morning.
