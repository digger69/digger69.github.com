Seems like everyone knew, except me. Windows 7 Home Professional doesn't allow incoming RDP connections. I found this out after repaving my XP Pro box that sits in the basement... RDP is a definite must.




 




My google research showed there are a couple places where you can download a patch that unlocks this ability in W7HP. But, like I'm gonna do that...




 




The next choice was UltraVNC. I've used VNC in the past and it works reasonably. The issue I found was most of the FAQs on how to install had disable UAC as step 1... again, not my first choice.




 




Then, I found a reference to Live Mesh supported a remote desktop feature. On digging, turns out Live Mesh is being deprecated for a new Live Synch available [here](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials-beta).  So, I installed this on the box and now can remote in fine.  As can anyone else on the 'net with an account ... hmmm...
