I leaned heavily on WinMerge on Windows and today went looking for a Mac equivalent. OSx had built in FileMerge which is reasonable. Opendiff can be used from terminal. However, I downloaded DiffMerge from [http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/](http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/)

Another one I will try soon is Meld from [http://meldmerge.org/ ](http://meldmerge.org/ )
