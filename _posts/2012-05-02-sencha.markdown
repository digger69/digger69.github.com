Built my first Sencha app by following the [video](http://vimeo.com/37974749) and online [tutorial](http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2-0/#!/guide/first_app). The app lists my recent blog posts and allows clicking to view. Sencha allows this html 5 app to run int he browser as well as package natively for IOS and Android.

##### Building


_Build production 26'23"_

    
     sencha app build production


Note: Web app should have 'add to home' when browsed.

_Build native 29'00"_
see packager.json for applicationName, version,

    
     sencha app build native


since the packager.json has platform: "IOSSimulator" will open for that. Changing that to "IOS" will build native IOS app.

_Android 32'54"_
First download [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html). Unzip and run 'android' from folder to download additional SDK dependencies.
