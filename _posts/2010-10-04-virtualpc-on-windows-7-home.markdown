If you go to the official Virtual PC website ([http://www.microsoft.com/virtualpc](http://www.microsoft.com/virtualpc)) and indicate that you are running Windows 7 Home – you will be (correctly) informed that you are not eligible to run Windows _XP Mode_. This is desceptive since you should still be able to download and run just Virtual PC as this blog post indicates : [http://blogs.msdn.com/b/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2010/07/07/installing-windows-virtual-pc-on-windows-7-home-editions.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2010/07/07/installing-windows-virtual-pc-on-windows-7-home-editions.aspx). You can download Virtual PC for Windows 7 directly from [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2B6D5C18-1441-47EA-8309-2545B08E11DD](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2B6D5C18-1441-47EA-8309-2545B08E11DD).




 




Or, just install the also free [VMWare Player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player/) 3.1 which all reports inidicate runs XP faster with more options.
