When I work, I tend to be very verbose with my commits - save often, if you will. So, however, I usually don't want to push all of that chatter up, rather I want to consolidate all the changes as one. Enter git rebase; aka squash the commits. There are many articles outlining the process.Â I've bookmarked this [post](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) for reference.
