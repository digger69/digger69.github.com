I've been meaning to come back and put a little refresh on the blog, make it a little more responsive, etc. 
I found I had some extra time With Christmas break upon us and was inspired by Joshua Lande's 
<a href='http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/'>post</a>. 

First step was to update the github-pages (20 -> 40) which brought along lots of goodies including Jekyll (1.5.1 -> 2.4.0).
One happy surprise was support for SASS (thought I'm a LESS fan now). But, it was an interesting exercise to make the
coffee stain logo responsive using SASS.
