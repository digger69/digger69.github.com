I've been meaning to come back and put a little refresh on the blog, make it a little more responsive, etc. 
I found I had some extra time With Christmas break upon us and was inspired by Joshua Lande's 
<a href='http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/'>post</a>. 

First step was to update the github-pages (20 -> 40) which brought along lots of goodies including Jekyll (1.5.1 -> 2.4.0).
One happy surprise was support for SASS, though I'm a fan LESS. Ot was an interesting exercise to make the coffee stain 
logo responsive using SASS.

Next was to get Google Analytics set up which was pretty easy once I understood the difference between Google Tag Manager
and Google Analytics.

Next steps: 

- try to get my daughter off wordpress and blogging with markdown ;)
- blog more (angular2, gulp, react)
