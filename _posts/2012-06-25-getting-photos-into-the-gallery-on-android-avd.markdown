From android sdk's tools folder run:

    
    android


From Tools menu, Manage AVDs. Select the AVD and click Edit the AVD. to include a 100mb sd card image.

Note: Go ahead and bump RAM up to 1gb while you're in here.

Launch the emulator and run this AVD

    
    emulator @myavd


Now there are a couple ways to mount the SD card once the emulator is running.Â [http://androidforums.com/developer-101/463412-how-access-files-avd-sd-card.html](http://androidforums.com/developer-101/463412-how-access-files-avd-sd-card.html), however I found that the SDK allowed me to :
1. shell into the AVD using adb (which is in platform-tools, not tools).

    
    adb shell


2. Make the appropriate folder

    
    mkdir sdcard/Pictures
    exit


3. Copy a picture from my local file sytem over.

    
    ./adb push ~/Pictures/IMAG0381.jpg sdcard/Pictures


There may have been a way to copy the file over w/ shelling in, but this is another helpful tidbit.
