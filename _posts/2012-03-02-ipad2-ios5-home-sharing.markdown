I just want to listen to my music on my iPad in the house... I don't want to use iCloud and Google Music via Safari doesn't work well - keeps stopping when the iPad goes dark. Reading up, it seems that prior to iOS5 there was an iPod app on the iPad. This has Â now been replaced with Music. Now, how to get home sharing to work. I was surprised how hard this was to find.

First, on Mac w/ iTunes, go into Advanced and enable home sharing with your apple id.

Second, on you iPad configure Home Sharing via:

Settings -> Music -> Home Sharing and enter your apple id again.

Now, in the Music app on the iPad, select More (bottom right) and Shared -> your Mac.
