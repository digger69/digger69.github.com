As I meantioned in my last post, [http://blog.nadigs.net/mark/2012/03/09/iis-7-5/](http://blog.nadigs.net/mark/2012/03/09/iis-7-5/)Â I've been meaning to make my Windows Service that updates ZoneEdit for Dynamic DNS available. So, on my day off... Dusted off the PC and did a little vb.net coding to bring it up to vs2010, extract the config into config and published it on codeplex.

I literally haven't done any pc programming in over a year. The slowness of VS2010 and TFS were very noticable compared what I've been doing lately (RubyMine, git).
