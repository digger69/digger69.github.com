I recently downloadedÂ a number of ebooks that to my desktop and threw them all in a folder 'books'. I wondered how hard it would be customize the icon. Turns out it is super simple.


  1. Copy image (using preview)

	
  2. Open folder's info, click on image at the top of the info view and select Edit -> Paste.
