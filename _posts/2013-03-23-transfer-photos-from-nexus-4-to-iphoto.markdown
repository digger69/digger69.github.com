To get iPhoto to recognize my Nexus 4, I found I had to change the USB storage settings:

On the Nexus 4, go to **SETTINGS**. Bring up the **STORAGE**settings. Tap the little three square dots icon in the top right corner. Select “**USB computer connection**“. This will bring up two connection options.

You can select “**Media Device ([MTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol))**” which is the default setting and will NOT allow you to import you photos. The other option is to select “**Camera ([PTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_Transfer_Protocol))**“. This mode will allow you to import you photos. In Lightroom, for instance, the device immediately appears as “Nexus” in the photo importer.
