I've often been frusted with printing emails from Outlook, specifically when I don't want the header info (from/to/date). For example, printing a receipt email to me. Today I found that within Oultook 2007 you can select View in Browser from Actions in the Ribbon. This opens the email in the browser and provides a cleaner way to print.
