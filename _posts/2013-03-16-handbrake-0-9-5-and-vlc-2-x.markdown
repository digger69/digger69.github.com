Plenty of posts out there detailing the problem with VLC 2.0 and higher w/ handbrake. However, many of the solutions took me to broken links.  I went to the source and found the correct information there. See [https://forum.handbrake.fr/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=23301](https://forum.handbrake.fr/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=23301) for a good link to the libdvdcss package.
