Today the wife asked how the kids could easily switch between the external usb speakers and the usb headset for audio. Well, it's about 5 clicks in windows 7 - from control panel... don't want the kids in there. Found this today.

Lets you easily switch between audio devices. (open source AutoLT script)




 




[correction - in Windows 7, right click on speaker icon -> Playback Devices and then set default. But the tray tool makes it easier]  LMK if there are easier ways to do this.
