Found this looking up a quote on "_If all that we say in a single day..."_ after listening to a message from A. Begg on Luke 6 [http://www.truthforlife.org/resources/sermon/the-golden-rule/](http://www.truthforlife.org/resources/sermon/the-golden-rule/ ) and stumbled across this great page

[http://freshlyground.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/watch-your-mouth/](http://freshlyground.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/watch-your-mouth/)

ended up using it as a family study. Good stuff.
