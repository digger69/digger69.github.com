I had to re-[uninstall IE9](/personal/marknadig/Blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=152)Â when I found that Office Project Web Access failed to display any of my tasks. My fallback was to use Chrome for any beta issue I ran into, but PWA only works with IE. Google-foo was failing me... no hits so far. Many hits on unhappy IE9 users. To be expected since beta and everyone loves to hate M$.
