In the months since my last [Back to Windows post]({% post_url 2016-04-22-back-to-windows %}) I've had a few additions to my toolbox

### Visual Studio Plugins:
[Save All The Time](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/ee676c7f-83e8-4ef8-87ab-22a95ae8f1d4) - automatically save, all the time   
[Productivity Power Tools 2015](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/34ebc6a2-2777-421d-8914-e29c1dfa7f5d) - lots of useful helps
   

### Windows apps:
[WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/) - Disk usage statistics viewer and cleanup tool
