Copy Output from Command Line Applications to the Clipboard


To copy text from a command to the clipboard, we'll just pipe it into the clip command, like this:


| clip


For example, if you wanted to output from the echo command into the clipboard, you could do this:


![](/personal/marknadig/Blog/Lists/Photos/091010_1924_CLIPEXEcopy1.png)
		

You can also use redirection to send a text file directly into the clip utility, like this:


clip < filename.txt


In this example I'm gonna put the contents of the single.php file onto the clipboard:


![](/personal/marknadig/Blog/Lists/Photos/091010_1924_CLIPEXEcopy2.png)
		

Of course, you could also use the type command and then pipe it to the clipboard like so:


![](/personal/marknadig/Blog/Lists/Photos/091010_1924_CLIPEXEcopy3.png)
