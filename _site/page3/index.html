    <p>I had ripped a bunch of MP3s in iTunes for my daughter only to find it took too much space for her player. I transcoded the MP3s to 96kbps in iTunes which resulted in two files:
<code>original.mp3
original 1.mp3</code></p>

<p>I now wanted to delete all the originals, and rename the sequenced versions by dropping the numeric sequence:</p>

<p>`</p>

<h1>copy off the keepers</h1>

<p>mv <em>1.mp3 tmp
rm *.mp3
mv tmp/</em>.mp3 .
rm tmp</p>

<h1>rename, removing &#39; 1&#39; sufffix</h1>

<p>for n in *.mp3
do
mv &quot;$n&quot; &quot;$(echo $n | sed -e &#39;s/ 1.mp3/.mp3/&#39;)&quot;
done`</p>

    <p>When I would try to run chkdsk /R on my my Windows 7 laptop, it would, of course, say the volume is locked and asked if I wanted to run on reboot. &quot;Yes, of course.&quot;, reboot ... nothing. I found this thread helpful:</p>

<p>I was not able to run chkdsk from a command prompt from safe mode. I was able to create a recovery DVD, boot to that and run chkdsk from a command prompt.</p>

    <p>I finally got around to setting up my shiny new Chromecast. The instructions indicate &quot;3 easy steps&quot;: 1. plug it in, 2. switch input, 3. set it up. The last part of setup, the Chromecast tries to connect to the wireless network. It failed and I was directed to a KB that no longer exists, but found in cache:</p>

<p>https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/3213084</p>

<blockquote>

> 
> # Learn More: AP Isolation is enabled

</blockquote>

<blockquote>Your Wi-Fi network configuration prevents devices from communicating with Chromecast. In order to resolve this issue, you will need to disable AP (access point) isolation, also known as client isolation, on your router. Please refer to your router documentation to learn how to disable AP isolation.

If you do not have access to your router settings, or if you are attempting to connect through a guest, hotel or public network with AP/client isolation, you will be unable to set up your Chromecast.

If you are attempting to connect through a Wi-Fi extender, please check your extender settings. You will need to disable AP isolation on your Wi-Fi extender before setting up Chromecast to work with your Wi-Fi network.</blockquote>

<p>I confirmed that AP Isolation was diabled on the router. I searched around and found <a href="http://mattstard.com/google-chromecast-cisco-e3000-router-fix/">another user had run into this</a> and his solution was to install ddwrt on the e3000. I was reluctant to potentially take down my home network, so reached out to Google support. Their response identified the root cause which is the e3000 is a dual band router and Chromecast only works with the 2.4GHz band.  So, giving each band a unique SSID solved my issue. Interestingly, I found the Google has already updated their docs w/ this possible cause: <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/3228330?hl=en"> https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/3228330?hl=en</a></p>

    <p>When I work, I tend to be very verbose with my commits - save often, if you will. So, however, I usually don&#39;t want to push all of that chatter up, rather I want to consolidate all the changes as one. Enter git rebase; aka squash the commits. There are many articles outlining the process. I&#39;ve bookmarked this <a href="http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html">post</a> for reference.</p>
